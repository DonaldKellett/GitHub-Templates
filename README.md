# GitHub-Templates
This repo contains all the GitHub templates that are available for project pages.
After downloading it, you can use it for your main site or whatever.
Please note that some of the files at the top (e.g. index.html, stylesheets, javascripts) belong to the default GitHub Template (also known as "Slate").
